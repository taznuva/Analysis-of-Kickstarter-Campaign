# Analysis-of-Kickstarter-Campaign
Dataset of Kickstarter Campaigns and Funding Goals

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to visualize and understand the campaign outcomes based on their funding goals and launch dates. In the process of this analysis, it's also to build the skills in Excel that are used to analyze large sets of data thru use of sorting, filtering, using functions such as =ROUND(), =AVERAGAE(), and =COUNTIFS(), as well as using PivotTables, PivotCharts, and bar graphs for a more comprehensive look of the data. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges that I encountered was using the COUNTIFS() for the Deliverable 2 portion of this assignment. The total count of successful, failed, and canceled for each goal (row) was 1 off. I have double checked on the Kickstarter sheet, filtered on the 'outcomes', 'goal' and 'subcategory' for each and it did not match. I've also checked to see if I wrote the function properly, retyped it on a new sheet, and eventually asked for help from the Learning Assistant. They've also encountered the same issue as I did and told me to ignore the count(off by 1) and resume what I'm doing. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May and June had the highest amount of successful campaigns which means that early summer is the best time for Louise to run a theater campaign. The theater category also had the least amount of canceled campaigns throughout the whole year. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Goals that are more reasonable attainable, for instance, less than $1000, are more likely to be successful than a unrealistic, rather more expensive, goal like more than $40,000. A goal that's less than a $1000 would mean that the average of donations would also be less but more people are willing to donate a few cents than a few dollars. Unless you're just super rich, but that would be considered an outlier in the data. Likewise, the higher the goal amount, the more likely it is to fail due to few or no pledges, in other words, people have to donate more money on average.  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could use pie charts/bar graph to see which categories or subcategories are more popular filtered by the successful. A line graph for each subcategory to see the trends for each year. 
If Louisa wasn't just interested in the plays/theater category, we could also create a pivot table to see what were the top 3 categories by the amount of successful campaigns.
